This project aims to build a website for computers and provides results about them
using a technique called web scraping. This technique will make our website different than
any Palestinian commercial website by collecting a set of data from given URL pages that
having content related to computer devices. The scraper saves time and gives more reliable
results. Moreover, the website shall facilitate user to user sale process through advertisements
that would be published by the registered users. The proposed project’s main focus is
investigating how useful and efficient it is to get search results from many Palestinian
websites using only one website. These results will be gained by two main resources which
are other local websites and the posted data by our websites’ members. The first resource
results will be legally gained because the purchase process will be done on the source website
in which the data has been extracted from.


-For web scraping we used Scrapy framework.
-For website backend we used Django framework.
-For website frontend we used Angular framework.
-For storing data we used MongoDB NOSQL database.
